BlockPlacement 1.0
==================

BlockPlacement is a C++ algorithm designed to give all possible combinations of arranging a defined set of blocks in a specified space. The blocks cannot be arranged so they overlap the space, and must take up the full amount of space. It is assuming that there are an infinite number of blocks, but they are limited by the sizes defined.
